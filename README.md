Music explorer
==============

This is a small piano that can be used to learn and explore basic
music theory. All keys have their note names, and you can select
scales and chords and see how they look (and sound!) on the piano. You
will also see which chords fit in the scale, and have the chance to
easily play them and experiment with them.

If you want to see it in action, go to:

Motivation
----------

Having learned a bit of guitar, music theory felt disconnected from
the instrument and hard to relate to. However, seeing the scales and
chords on a piano made everything click and make sense. This is a
humble attempt to help other people learn the basics of music theory
in a visual way, with an interactive piano. It might also be useful
for inspiration and maybe even to help write some songs.

Technically, it's a small experiment to learn React, more EcmaScript
6, and a bit more music theory. The HTML and CSS was shamelessly
stolen from http://codepen.io/garypaul/pen/jgKqc.
