      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>Music Explorer is a simple application to explore and learn
      music theory. It's designed to see how notes, chords and scales fit
      together, more than as a piano to be played.</p>

      <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
      <p>On startup, all keys are dimmed. You can select a scale on
      the left, or type a chord name on the right, and the
      corresponding keys will be highlighted.</p>

      <p>When you choose a scale, you will see the basic chords that
      fit in that scale. Clicking on their names will play them and
      mark the different notes that comprise them. These notes will
      have a mark stating the role of the note in the chord: "R" for
      "root", "M3" for "major third", "P5" for "perfect fifth" and so
      on. If you have a scale selected and you play a chord that
      doesn't fit, the offending chord notes will be highlighted in
      red.</p>

      <p>If you know the chords to a song, you can try typing the
      chord names, and then guessing the song melody by playing the
      notes in each chord.</p>

      <h1>Technical details</h1>
      <p>Music Explorer is written in JavaScript
      (<a href="http://es6-features.org/">ES6</a> to be more precise)
      and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, and
      uses the
      fantastic <a href="https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria">teoria</a>
      JavaScript music
      library, <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> and
      other code and tools. I got the piano markup and CSS
      from <a href="http://codepen.io/garypaul/pen/jgKqc">this codepen
      by Gary Paul</a>, and the piano note samples I got
      from <a href="http://www.vibrationdata.com/piano.htm">Vibrationdata.com</a>.</p>
